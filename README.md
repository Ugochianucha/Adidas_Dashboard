The analysis I did in this report involved cleaning, transforming, and structuring my data set. I used pivot tables and slicers in analysing my data and its visualisation.
The Key Insights:
1. Total sales trend
2. Top 10 states with the highest total sales
3. Proportional sales to total sales
4. Total sales by retailers
